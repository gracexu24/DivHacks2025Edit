We are trying to provide a safe and empowering space for students who identify as part of an underrepresented group in tech, but we welcome everyone who feels they would benefit from this type of space! If you feel this hackathon in not right for you as a hacker, but you would like to participate in some other way as a mentor, workshop leader, or volunteer, please contact us!'

Throughout the hackathon, there will be workshops aimed towards beginners in different areas including workshops for those with no prior programming experience at all. This year, we especially hope to focus on creating tracks that even people without any experience can leave the event with a project!'

            <span className="highlight">DivHacks</span>, founded in 2017, is Columbia University's premier student-led
            annual diversity hackathon. Over the past seven years, DivHacks has
            welcomed attendees from all over the tri-state area. We strive to create
            an empowering and inspirational space for students who are historically
            underrepresented in the tech industry. Our goal is an experience that
            not only reimagines what diversity should look like in the tech industry
            but gives students the tools to use technology to implement change.
